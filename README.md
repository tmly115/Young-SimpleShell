# Young SimpleShell
Young SimpleShell, or yss, is a easy to use and extremely effective command line for unix based systems. Unlike command lines
such as bash, Young SimpleShell uses explicit language instead of symbols in the command line to make it easier to
use. It's currently a work in progress though you are more than welcome to download and compile the current
source code and try it out, however the functionality is currently very limited.

# Installation
Clone the repository
cd into the repo and then type the following commands

To compile:
```
make
```
To run the shell:
```
./yss_dev
```
Please, execute the next commands how administrador

To install in you Operating System
```
make -i install
```
For remove of you Operating System 
```
make -i clean
```

Note: You can exit out of it with Ctrl^C like any normal program

# Usage
yss can be executed from the bash shell or can be set as a users default shell. Currently the shell
does have very limited functionality but can be used to execute all day to day shell tasks, such as
executing other shell programs and commands. To see the built-in yss commands in yss enter 'help' into
the command line. These are the commands that yss executes itself, to achieve other tasks the programs
will have the same names as in bash. For example 'ls' will list the contents of the current directory
and you can still use 'nano' to edit a file.
